# JS-OS-Desktop
Everyone can make Apps and changes to the Desktop.
When creating an App, make sure to make a folder in the apps folder, name the folder your app name. make sure to name the main part of the app index.html to allow the run app to open it.
if you want your app to be able to open a "dialogbox". be sure to include a <script src=> to window.js and use createWindow(windowtitle,htmlfile); in your code.
